# Utils Folder

This folder contains code that can be used to reduce the hassle of loading, preprocessing, training, visualizing etc. Any sort of boilerplate code can be put here. The goal is to write reusable and well-documented code i.e. Clean Code, which you can use to automate the menial, grunt work and get it done faster. This will help speed up the overall process of data analysis and predictive modelling.

To Do:
1. Add tests for each of the functions written in `utils/trainer.py`
